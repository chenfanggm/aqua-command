## 📊 SOLID Principles Compliance

### ✅ Single Responsibility Principle
- Commands: Data only
- Handlers: Logic only  
- CommandBus: Routing only
- LockManager: Locking only

### ✅ Open/Closed Principle
- Add new commands without modifying core
- Extensible via interfaces
- Closed to modification

### ✅ Liskov Substitution Principle
- All ICommand implementations interchangeable
- All ICommandHandler<T> implementations interchangeable
- Mock implementations supported

### ✅ Interface Segregation Principle
- Small focused interfaces (ILockingCommand, IProgressCommand, etc.)
- Commands only implement what they need
- No fat interfaces

### ✅ Dependency Inversion Principle
- High-level depends on abstractions
- Low-level implements abstractions
- Constructor injection for dependencies

## 📈 Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Queue insertion | O(log n) |
| Lock acquisition | O(k) where k = number of locks |
| Memory allocation | Zero-allocation async (UniTask) |
| Thread safety | Full |
| Memory leaks | None (proper cleanup) |

## 🎯 Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture Found

**Your Current System:**
```
ActionSystem (coroutine-based)
  ├── GameAction (base class)
  ├── DrawCardAction
  ├── DealDamageAction
  └── Performers (registered statically)
```

**Issues Identified:**
- Single-threaded (IsPerforming lock)
- Static dictionaries (not testable)
- No entity locking
- No validation
- No progress tracking
- Tight coupling

**Your Current DI:**
- Uses Reflex framework ✅
- Scene-based installers ✅
- Attribute-based injection ✅

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start (5 minutes)

1. **Install UniTask** (required dependency):
   ```
   Package Manager → Add package from git URL:
   https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask.git?path=src/UniTask/Assets/Plugins/UniTask
   ```

2. **Update your GameSceneInstaller**:
   ```csharp
   [SerializeField] private CommandBusInstaller _commandBusInstaller;
   
   public void InstallBindings(ContainerBuilder builder)
   {
       builder.AddSingleton(_pointerInput);
       _commandBusInstaller.InstallBindings(builder);
   }
   ```

3. **Use in your code**:
   ```csharp
   [Inject] private AsyncCommandBus _commandBus;
   
   void OnCookRequest()
   {
       var cmd = new CookCommand(campfire, meat);
       _commandBus.Enqueue(cmd);
   }
   ```
