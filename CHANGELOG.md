## Migration Guide

### From Manual Command System

If you're currently using a custom command system, follow these steps:

1. **Install package** via UPM or local import
2. **Create command DTOs**:
   ```csharp
   // Before
   public void Attack(int attackerId, int targetId) { }
   
   // After
   public class AttackCommand : ICommand {
       public readonly int AttackerId;
       public readonly int TargetId;
   }
   ```

3. **Create handlers**:
   ```csharp
   public class AttackHandler : CommandHandlerBase<AttackCommand> {
       public override async UniTask<CommandResult> ExecuteAsync(...) { }
   }
   ```

4. **Setup command bus**:
   ```csharp
   var bus = new AsyncCommandBus();
   bus.RegisterHandler(new AttackHandler(...));
   ```

5. **Replace method calls with commands**:
   ```csharp
   // Before
   gameManager.Attack(1, 2);
   
   // After
   bus.Enqueue(new AttackCommand(1, 2));
   ```
